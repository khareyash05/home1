      content="My name is Yash Khare. Iâ€™m a first year student pursuing bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering at AKGEC,Ghaziabad. I'm most passionate about giving back to the community, and my goal is to pursue this passion within the field of software engineering. n my free time, I love to play tennis and listen to 
      rock music to cheer me up for the next task.If you dont find me at Home , you can find me at the nearest planetariums(I love to 
      observe and talk about the universe).Altogether, I would sum up myself as an enthusiast and a hardworker; who would do anything to complete the 
      task. My colleagues have always likes this behavior of mine and I hope my clients as well do!."

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
